Remember The Match
==================

Never forget about an important match by automatically adding it to your task management app!

Run the tests:

```bash
./bin/nosetests
```

Run the app using your Todoist account credentials:

```bash
./bin/rtm --username <login> --password <password>
```

Or check out help:

```bash
./bin/rtm --help
```

The biggest trick is that at the moment it does nothing.
But I'm working on it!

What's working at the moment?
* NOTHING!

Current goals:
* support Premier League (http://www.premierleague.com)
* support Todoist app (http://todoist.com)

Mid-term goals:
* support Remember The Milk
* support Primera Division
* support Champions League

Long term goals:
* support all major European leagues
* support all major task management apps
